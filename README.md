# Hi, I'm Kacper! ðŸ‘‹

### A little bit about myself.
I'm a web developer who's absolutely passionate about creating amazing websites. I'm a bit of a perfectionist when it comes to design, so I always make sure that every pixel is in its right place. As a front-end developer, I place a lot of emphasis on creating a great user experience. After all, that's what really matters to the people who use the sites I build! 

# My portfolio
Welcome to my portfolio repository! Here, you'll find a collection of my work and experience, all presented in a fun and casual way. I used Nuxt.js and TailwindCss to create this portfolio, which showcases my skills and projects.
